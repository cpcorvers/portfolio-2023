      When is an action morally right for a professional and organisations in the context of collaborating organisations around a multi-problem family?

      The elective, practical case study and the different views of Rawls, Derrida, Kohlberg and others ween from the perspective of study for humanities. The course on the 7-steps moral inquiry method learned me the techniques and the tool to guide professionals in a inquiry on a moral dilemma and organisations in moral learning. In the resulting paper I reflect literature and practice on the stated question.

      When I understood deconstruction —if such moment exist— the aporia of justice became a beautiful work of art, a tool to find truth and just in the opposing positions found in the reality of everyday life. The aporia —with the tree dimensions— was helpful in the identification and weighting of the opposing arguments in the practical case because I had to search for equally 'important' rules and ask myself what would happen if the decision was postponed.Understanding Derrida enriched my skill to analyze real life situation and reflect on arguments, skills through which I can serve others in awareness and understanding of their impact on a sustainable development of society.
  - head: Rawls

      Reading the literature, participating in the lectures and reflecting Rawls’ theory in the practice of my profession —as a servant of the state— I started to understand the idiom of Rawls, learned to apply his arguments by trial and error in my daily life and endeavor the outcome of the abstract theory in practice of politics in the Netherlands by reflecting on news articles. You can disagree on the theory of justice but it provides an idiom to argue on the matters of politics, the execution of the power of the collective body and the organisation of government, all in light of justice. This understanding enriched my knowledge on the structure of society and gives insights how to transform our society to fit the contemporary view on justice we have reached so far.

      Different scenes create different roles of the actor, as I take on different roles in the different habitats of this society. For some see the soldier, military engineer, creative director, or old industrial design student others see an independent entrepreneur, consultant, creative mind, technician, yoga teacher or coach. Either way all these roles are enriched by the knowledge and skills of the servant of justice. The method will support decision making of myself and whom I serve, the knowledge will argue the perceptions on reality, the authors and teacher became a compass in this quest to justice and transformation and the insight enrich and complicate my vision of a sustainable transformation of society.

      The research on justice was a delightful path with no answers but better questions focused on the things that matter most.
