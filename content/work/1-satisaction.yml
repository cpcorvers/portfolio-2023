      "Once people begin to act, they generate tangible outcomes in some context and this helps them discover what is occurring, what needs to be explained and what should be done next" (Weick, 1995, p.55). This text describes the intended meaning of the Satis-action method through which participants start acting together and generate tangible outcomes and a tangible context of the specific case or project they are working in. By doing so, they discover the ongoing situation (awareness), start explaining to each other their professional interpretation of the problem and the actions they can undertake (understanding), and thereby identify possible next steps towards a comprehensive solution.
