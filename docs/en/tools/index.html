      The System Constellation Plays are sets of 'low-res' wooden artefacts we call characters. These characters represent an organisation, community, group or person. The characters are placed on a flat surface like a floor or table. The thoughtfull placement creates a two dimensional constellation of characters. This constellation is an overview on positions of the actors in the network. Observers of the constellation see the different stages from all perspectives which enrich the insights on the structure of a multi-actor network.

      <p class="technique-normal">
      
      The System Constellation Play is used in the <a href=https://www.satis-action.nl>Satis-Action method</a> and is currently made in two sizes, XL and Small. The System Constellation Play XL is used for User-journeys and Showcases during workshops in large rooms on the floor. The System Constellation Play Small is used by care professionals and coaches in meetings with clients to explain their situation within a multi-actor network.

      The Perception board is an instrument with a horizontal and vertical placed monitor and characters from the System Constellation Play Small. On the horizontal monitor a specific underground is visualised. Characters are positioned by a single professional on the horizontal monitor. This creates a specific bird-eye view constellation of the relevant actors in the network as perceived by the profesional. On a vertical monitor the same constellation is visualised from a landscape view. The different views give more perspectives of the professional on the constellation and thereby gives information for the professional to create a more acurate perception on the specific case at hand.

      The Perception board was created during a studyproject in 2019 and observed by experts and scolars during the universities Demoday. The digital demonstrator is not tested in a reallife case and now dismantled. The concept is in use as an analog tool during workshops on wicked problems.
