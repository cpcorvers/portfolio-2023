	<h3>
		Research enquiry
	</h3>
	<p>
		Observed from a humanistic point of view, what are organisations and how do they relate to society and individuals in a socio-political context?

	</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>
		Insights
	</h3>
	<p>
		During the elective Organizations 1 at the University of Humanistic studies in Utrecht I acquired knowledge of –amongst others– Deleuze's rhizome theory (Deleuze & Guattari, 2004), Du Gay's praise of bureaucracy (Du Gay, 2000) and Weick's sensemaking in organizations (Weick, 1995). In the final essay I deliberate on the origin of the market as a common ground, organisation as a mesosystem, the unnatural rational of tree-structures and the homo sapiens as part of the closed system –what Nature arguably is– with the need to restore its harmony.

Exploring the organisation as an artificial human constructs (Harari, 2017) from a humanistic point of view gave in-depth understanding of the local and global issues of the transformation paradigm and the structure and dynamics of a collaborating society (Brand & Rocchi, 2011).

	<h3>
		Conclusion
	</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed during the lectures, I describe an organisation as the affairs which arise around an idea. The organisation is not the idea itself but only the combination of people, resources and methods which let the idea grow and flourish. From this description one can argue about the meaning of a specific organisation and find out if an organisations is own its original track, changing its purpose or in its last phase before liquidation.
